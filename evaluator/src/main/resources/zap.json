The underlying cause is application functionality using predictable URL/form actions in a repeatable way. The nature of the attack is that CSRF exploits the trust that a web site has for a user. By contrast, cross-site scripting (XSS) exploits the trust that a user has for a web site. Like XSS, CSRF attacks are not necessarily cross-site, but they can be. Cross-site request forgery is also known as CSRF, XSRF, one-click attack, session riding, confused deputy, and sea surf.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:<\/p><p>    * The victim has an active session on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.<\/p><p>    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site.<\/p><p><\/p><p>CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered to disclose information by gaining access to the response. The risk of information disclosure is dramatically increased when the target site is vulnerable to XSS, because XSS can be used as a platform for CSRF, allowing the attack to operate within the bounds of the same-origin policy.<\/p>",

Then, these modified values would be submitted to the server.<\/p><p><\/p><p>If available, use structured mechanisms that automatically enforce the separation between data and code.

When an encoding is not specified, the web browser may choose a different encoding by guessing which encoding is actually being used by the web page.

See CWE-116 for more mitigations related to encoding/escaping.<\/p><p><\/p><p>To help mitigate XSS attacks against the user's session cookie, set the session cookie to be HttpOnly. In browsers that support the HttpOnly feature (such as more recent versions of Internet Explorer and Firefox), this attribute can prevent the user's session cookie from being accessible to malicious client-side scripts that use document.cookie. This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers. More importantly, XMLHTTPRequest and other powerful browser technologies provide read access to HTTP headers, including the Set-Cookie header in which the HttpOnly flag is set.<\/p><p><\/p><p>Assume all input is malicious. Use an \"accept known good\" input validation strategy, i.e., use a whitelist of acceptable inputs that strictly conform to specifications. Reject any input that does not strictly conform to specifications, or transform it into something that does. Do not rely exclusively on looking for malicious or malformed inputs (i.e., do not rely on a blacklist). However, blacklists can be useful for detecting potential attacks or determining which inputs are so malformed that they should be rejected outright.<\/p><p><\/p><p>When performing input validation, consider all potentially relevant properties, including length, type of input, the full range of acceptable values, missing or extra inputs, syntax, consistency across related fields, and conformance to business rules. As an example of business rule logic, \"boat\" may be syntactically valid because it only contains alphanumeric characters, but it is not valid if you are expecting colors such as \"red\" or \"blue.\"<\/p><p><\/p><p>Ensure that you perform input validation at well-defined interfaces within the application.

This is not a complete solution, since HttpOnly is not supported by all browsers.
